# Predicting Blood Donation Pattern 
Blood donation is an essential activity to acquire blood as a raw material into the blood supply chain.  It must be managed effectively together with other processes in blood management.  In this research, the pattern of blood donorsâ€™ behaviors based on factors influencing blood donation decision is conducted using online questionnaire.  These factors, i.e., altruistic values, knowledge in blood donation, perceived risks, attitudes towards blood donation, and intention to donate blood, are analyzed to find out the possibilities for individuals to become blood donors.  The surveyed data are used for machine learning techniques of Artificial Intelligence,Neural Networks ,Random Forest and many other algorithms to predict the possibility of a person donating blood. On the dataset many algorithms and find out accuracy for each algorithm and find out the best algorithm for prediction.
